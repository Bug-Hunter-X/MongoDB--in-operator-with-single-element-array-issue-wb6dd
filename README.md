# MongoDB $in Operator with Single Element Array Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error related to the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries when used with single-element arrays. The issue arises when developers incorrectly assume that providing a single element array will work the same as providing the element directly, which is not always the case.  The provided code snippet showcases the error, and the solution provides a correct way to handle such cases.  This issue may result in unexpected query results and potentially incorrect application behavior. 

## Bug Description:

The original code attempts to find a document with the name 'John Doe' by using the `$in` operator with a single-element array. However, this approach does not yield the expected results, returning an empty array even if the document exists. This is because `$in` is designed for queries involving multiple values.  

## Solution:

The solution demonstrates the correct approach, directly comparing the `name` field to 'John Doe' without the unnecessary use of the `$in` operator, resulting in accurate query results.
